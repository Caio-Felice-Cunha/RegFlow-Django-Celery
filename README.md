**A streamlined Django-based registration flow powered by Celery for asynchronous task management.**

---

## üìñ Overview  
RegFlow-Django-Celery is a Django project that integrates Celery and Redis to handle asynchronous tasks like personalized email invitations with embedded registration tokens. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of background task execution in a Django application.

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

4. **Configure Redis**  
   Make sure Redis is installed and running. Update the `CELERY_BROKER_URL` in `regflow/settings.py` if necessary.  

5. **Apply Migrations**  
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```  

6. **Run Redis**  
   Start your Redis server:  
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```  

7. **Start Celery Worker**  
   Open a new terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   celery -A regflow worker --loglevel=info
   ```  

8. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```  

9. **Access the Application**  
   Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

## üõ† Usage  

1. Navigate to the homepage and fill out the registration form.  
2. Upon submission, Celery processes the request asynchronously to:  
   - Save the user‚Äôs data in the database.  
   - Generate a personalized invitation image.  
   - Send the invitation to the user‚Äôs email.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues  

- Celery worker startup might throw errors if Redis is not running.  
- No real email backend configuration for production; default is console email backend.  

---

## üåü Future Plans  

- Add support for other brokers like RabbitMQ.  
- Implement a production-ready email service using Gmail/SMTP.  
- Create a Docker container for easier deployment.
